## 📖 About

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks—**a generator** and **a discriminator**—compete against each other in a zero-sum game. This setup allows GANs to learn how to generate new, realistic data samples.

This repository provides:
- Custom GAN implementations.
- Pre-trained models for experimentation.
- Jupyter notebooks and tutorials for hands-on exploration.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Implementations of popular GAN architectures: `DCGAN`, `CycleGAN`, `StyleGAN`, and more.
- 🧰 Preprocessing utilities for custom datasets.
- 📊 Visualizations and evaluation metrics for training progress.
- 🔁 Easy-to-run experiments in Jupyter Notebooks.
